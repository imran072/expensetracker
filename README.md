# This was done for a project and the project name was: expensetracker

In this project I have created a web app that can be used to track expenses of our daily life. The
name of the app is Expense Tracker. Anyone with the link of the app can be able to register and
be able to ‘Create’, ‘Add’, ‘Edit’ and ‘Delete’ expenses.
The app has been created using Django following templating method. Bootstrap v4.5 has been
used to design the web pages and pipenv virtual environment has been used to install all the
dependencies. However, the app has not been deployed on a remote server so to run the app, the
process has to be started from the local machine and syncing the Pipfile.
